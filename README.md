# BuddyGet

A budget app for logging incomes and expenses. AppWrite is used to store and retrieve income and expenses. React Native and Nativewind is used for the interface design. I built this side project for the purpose of mastering React Native after being a web dev for many years.

## 📦 Technologies

- `React Native`
- `Nativewind`
- `Expo Router`
## 🦄 Features

Here is a detail of what you see when you use BuddyGet:

- **Sign Up Page**: You can register to use the application by signing up with your Username, Email address and password.

- **Log In Page**: This page allows you to login with your Email address and the password you created during signup.

- **Home Page**: This is the home screen. It shows a card displaying the total balance, expenses and income. It also include a tab view for recent transactions


## 👩🏽‍🍳 The Process

I started by building the screens with Nativewind and using expo router for file based routing. I created a appwrite project/database, set it up in my react app. I went ahead to create the authentication module and collections for storing the advices. 

The advice collection has three fields: author, content and status. I also implemented a role based authentication using firebase cloud functions.

## 📚 What I Learned

During this project, I've being able to master some React Native concepts and AppWrite functions.


### 📈 Overall Growth:

Each part of this project challenged me to learn something new things even though I'm not new to development.
